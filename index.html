        I'm thankful for having you as my juniors. I know that I'm not the best mentor but I'll always try my best to help you.
      </p>
      <p class="px-4 py-2">
        I know that you have a lot of things to learn. But I hope you can always
        find time to learn new things and to improve yourself.
      </p>
      <p class="px-4 py-2">
        Last but not least, always remember our true purpose in this world. We are here to serve Allah and to help others.
